Description: MICMIC is an information theory based package to infer the
    methylation involved regulation network. It contains some tools to 1. measure
    the mutual information and conditional mutual information between continuous
    variables; 2. construct direct correlation network; 3. study the methylation
    regulation for target genes within a given range on the genome.
